# cf-k8s-logging

cf-k8s-logging contains the portions of cf-for-k8s which enable logging
outcomes.

## API

### App Containers
Logs from app containers are automatically ingested and egressed from
cf-k8s-logging. App containers are expected to contain cloudfoundry.org/
labels which contain important app information. Namely, app_guid, and
source_type.

### System Components
Cf Components which wish to emit logs on behalf of apps may do so via the
[Forwarder Interface](https://docs.fluentd.org/output/forward).

The logs will be received by the fluent ingress service called `fluentd-forwarder-ingress` at port `24224` using the fluent forwarding protocol.
Libraries can to forward can be found at `https://github.com/fluent/fluent-logger-{ruby,golang,java}`, or a fluent/fluentd can be configured to
forward logs using an output plugin.

Examples are located [in the examples folder](examples)

***NOTE:***  To communicate with the Forwarder API, Istio sidecar injection must be enabled with the `istio-injection=enabled` label in the component's namespace.

#### Log Format
Logs emitted to cf-k8s-logging by system components must include the fields:
- app_id: id of the app for which the logs are being emitted.
- instance_id: id of the instance for which the logs are being emitted.
- source_type: source type of the logs. eg. STG
- log: log message to emit

```
{"log":"This is a test log from a fluent log producer","app_id":"11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111","instance_id":"1", "source_type":"APP"}
```

### Debug logging in cf-k8s-logging fluentd

To investigate fluentd closer, you can up the log level by setting the
environment variable `FLUENTD_FLAGS` on fluentd, like so
```
env:
- name: "FLUENTD_FLAGS"
  value: "-vvv"
```

`-vvv` is the highest logging level

Another way to see what is being sent is replacing the output with a stdout
logger:
```
<match **>
    @type stdout
</match>
```

### Development flow

1. make updates needed (update vendir, update k8s files, etc).
1. make local commit(should make reverting image tags easy)
1. run build ./scripts/build-images.sh, setting $REPOSITORY to a docker
   repository you can push to
1. run ./scripts/bump-cf-for-k8s.sh
1. follow cf-for-k8s deployment steps.
